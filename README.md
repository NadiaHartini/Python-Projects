# Welcome to My Python Portfolio

I'm excited to share my collection of projects for data science and data analysis using Python. 

Python, as a powerful and accessible programming language, provides a broad number of libraries that allow you to easily tackle data exploration, visualization, and even core machine learning tasks. This portfolio contains well-structured examples of fundamental abilities such as data cleansing, data exploration, data visualization, and machine learning modeling. Each project is designed to extract important insights from data and effectively communicate the outcomes in order to facilitate data-driven decision making. I will also include a selection of powerpoint explanations to help further convey my workflow. 

Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I hope you like my projects!
